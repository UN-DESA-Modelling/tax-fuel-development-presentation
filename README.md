This repository is part of the [UN-DESA Modelling Tools](https://un-desa-modelling.github.io/).

This is the static presentaion for the related simulation. You can
find a running version of it
[here](https://un-desa-modelling.github.io/tax-fuel-development-presentation/).

The visualisation can be found

## Simulation

A simulation of a fuel tax, a proxy for a carbon tax, in three
developing countries show differential impacts on GDP and in a set of
key social indicators.

Modelling results indicate that he impacts depend not only on how the
newly tax revenue is recycled back to the economy, but also on the
structural features prevalent in each country. Results confirm that
policy choices must be assessed on the basis of the specific
characteristics and objectives of each country and that policies are
not easily transferable across countries.

The visualization tool displays the results of alternative policy
options compared to the base line. The graphs allow for comparison
across scenarios, impact variables and countries.
